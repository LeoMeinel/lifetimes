 * 1. Each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter
 * 2. If there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output

 * 3. If there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self the
 * lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.
 * -> meaning that if there are multiple input lifetimes and none of them is &self -> no elision
